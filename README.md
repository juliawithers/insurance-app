## **What is inSUREance meant to do?**
The primary purpose of this app is to help users find a doctor near their location and have all insurances listed immediately. The idea tends toward simplicity and is meant to have as little user input as possible. API's used: BetterDoctor API and Mapquest Geocoding API.

The idea for this app stemmed from personal experiences in the healthcare industry and the difficulty in finding information up front about providers. In particular the specific insurances taken. Often you have to click through several pages of their websites to find any insurance information, and even then most of the time you must call as it's not listed. 

**PLEASE NOTE: As of July 2020, the BetterDoctor API is down and the company is not responding. I have sent three emails and called dozens of times over the last three-four weeks with no response whatsoever. Their phone line is completely dead. I suspect due to COVID they have shut down but I cannot confirm. I understand this is an issue, but there is not much to be done about that. I am searching for a new API, but none I have found are as comprehensive as BetterDoctor.

## **Future Updates**
I hope to expand the app in the future to include filtering by a certain insurance plan and add a map feature.
