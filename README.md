## **What is inSUREance meant to do?**
The primary purpose of this app is to help users find a doctor near their location and have all insurances listed immediately. The idea tends toward simplicity and is meant to have as little user input as possible. API's used: BetterDoctor API and Mapquest Geocoding API.

The idea for this app stemmed from personal experiences in the healthcare industry and the difficulty in finding information up front about providers. In particular the specific insurances taken. Often you have to click through several pages of their websites to find any insurance information, and even then most of the time you must call as it's not listed.
